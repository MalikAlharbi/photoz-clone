# Spring Boot Course API Tutorial

This repository is a hands-on implementation of a Spring Boot tutorial from [Marco Behler](https://github.com/marcobehler) channel. The project demonstrates how to build a simple Photoz clone while exploring essential Spring Boot features, such as:

- RESTful API creation with `@RestController`.
- Business logic implementation using the `@Service` annotation.
- Dependency injection for seamless communication between components.
- Classpath scanning and automatic configuration.
- Embedded Tomcat for standalone application deployment.
- Spring Data JDBC.
- SQL schema.
-  Working with the in-memory `H2 Database` for development and testing purposes.
- **Data Validation:** Implementing data validation using annotations like `@NotEmpty`, etc.
- **Deployment:** Packaging the application as a JAR file for easy deployment.
